## Briefly

This repository contains the code for our study that utilized participant-level XAI-based relevance maps (using *Layer-wise Relevance Propagation*, [LRP](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140)) derived from two ensembles of 3D-convolutional neural networks trained on T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) of 2016 participants, aged 18-82 years (as reported in [Hofmann et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119504)). These relevance maps were associated with various human-interpretable structural brain features, including regional cortical and subcortical gray matter volume and thickness, perivascular spaces, and water diffusion-based fractional anisotropy of primary white matter tracts.
The approach aimed to bridge voxel-based contributions to brain-age estimates with biologically meaningful structural features of the aging brain.
